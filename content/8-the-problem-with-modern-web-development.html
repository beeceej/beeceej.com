Here's what I see as one of the problems with modern web development.

</br>
Pictured above are automated pull requests for security vulnerabilities in core npm packages. The problem is, for some of these libraries, I couldn't tell you what they do, why they do it, or why my React application needs them. You know what <em>won't contain security vulnerabilities</em> years down the road? plain HTML, CSS and if you're feeling naughty a bit of vanilla Javascript.

Some might say:
<pre>Surely it's not difficult to keep up to date?</pre>
In response, I Say that I have better things to do than keep up to date with advancements in an ecosystem, that in many use-cases aren't even needed. TLDR; don't make things more complicated than they need to be.
