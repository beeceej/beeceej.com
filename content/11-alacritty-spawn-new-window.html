I've been using <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a> for nearly a year on my mac, but only just made the switch on my Fedora machine. I used to be one of those people who used iTerm2 because everyone told me it was "better", but I never actually used half of its feature-set. Because of Alacritty's simplicity and lack of tabs, I relied on CMD+n to open up new instances of Alacritty pretty often, and was surprised when that key command didn't work on my Fedora machine.

If you're running <pre class="inline">alacritty 0.9.0</pre>, getting it to create a new instance is an easy fix. You need to provide this argument to the <pre class="inline">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.yml</pre> file.
<pre>
### ...
### ...
key_bindings:
  - { key: N, mods: Control|Shift, action: SpawnNewInstance }
### ...
### ...
</pre>
Turns out <pre class="inline">SpawnNewInstance </pre> used to be called <pre class="inline">CreateNewWindow</pre>.

It's likely this will be fixed upstream soon, but until then this configuration does the trick.
