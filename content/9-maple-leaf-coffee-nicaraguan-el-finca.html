I recently bought some beans from <a href="https://mapleleafroasters.com/">Maple Leaf Coffee Roasters</a>, where the roaster just happens to be an old coworker. Every time I buy beans from Alex, they're extremely fresh. The beans are extremely gassy, and let off a nice fragrance when bloomed. This time around, I purchased the <a href="https://mapleleafroasters.store/collections/light-roasts/products/nicaragua-finca-el-pastoral-natural-light-roast">Nicaraguan Finca El Pastoral</a>. And without further ado, here is the review.

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>22 grams of coffee, semi-finely ground</li>
  <li>350g water, at ~212 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
  <li>Brewed in my aeropress, stirred 25 times (~7 seconds), pressed over a 20 second period</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Experience</h3>
<ul>
  <li>While brewing, there is a nice, fruity smell wafting through the air.</li>
  <li>The tasting notes listed on the packaging are true to form, watermelon on the nose middling with a tart sweetness, and an almost buttery ending of white chocolate.</li>
  <li>I can feel the caffeine jolt from this light roast. Nice!</li>
</ul>
