I really enjoy hot chili's, and now that we've moved into our new house, we have a bit more space for things like growing peppers. I started out germinating some Trinidad Moruga Scorpion Pepper seeds in my aerogarden. I placed 2-3 seeds in each slot, and set the aerogarden to the "vegetable" setting. After about 2-3 weeks, I ended up with over 80% germination rate. Unfortunately only a couple of the seedlings are really thriving, but in general they're doing pretty well.

About 3 weeks in, I took 2 seedlings and planted them outdoors, under our covered patio, they seem to be doing well, but they're definitely growing somewhat slower than the seedlings I left in our aerogarden. Here's what the aerogarden seedlings look like.

Early July was probably a bit late in the season to be starting seeds, and planting them outdoors, but I'm hopin for some fruit just before the temperatures start getting cold, I have high hopes though for the indoor hydrophonic plants. I'll post back here when they start flowering ;)!
